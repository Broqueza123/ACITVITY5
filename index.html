  <h2>Reason </h2> 
  <p>Why did you start to write a journal? Most people asked that. I always tell them that it is because it becomes my home and safe place. Just like having someone that you can talk to everyday about your day. But for me, sharing my day with my journal is such a safe place to tell, because there is no judgement on it. You could feel the comfort here just like when you are in the real home. Whenever the world is mean or nice to me, I am still going to write on it, because I could get a lesson from it or once I read it in the future, I can proudly say that I did well from being strong in this situation.</p>

  <h3> Hello! Welcome to My Journal! As you read this journal, I really hope you enjoyed this and learned from it. </h3>
  <p>I will share to you my Christmas Journey, how it went and what I learned from that day.

Christmas, I don't have sleep at that time cause there's a lot of something that I did, so I wasn't able to sleep, so I started to get ready at 3:30 am in the morning, but before that I prayed to God. When, I was done getting ready, I waited for someone and we went to Church at 4:30 am, it was such a rush because we were late at that time and we have to be on time because we are part of a ministry. When we got into church, I thank God because it hasn't started yet. Later on, the church started the day with prayer and devotion. And the praising and the preach also started. It was so fun that time because there was a lot of money that we got and there were a lot of greetings. I really enjoyed that time, but not until we have to leave the church. We struggle cause there's a flood outside the church and we have to walk in there. We are having a hard time cause it's also mist. I didn't go home that time, I was with my mama and niece, we went to the hair salon of my tita and waited for another family because we are going together in carbonara for a family reunion. And when we went there, I had a lot of fun, I met the family of my father's side, there's a lot of food, games and gifts. I really enjoyed it. When we got home, I took a shower and my friends chatted with me that we were going to eat outside, I also brought the person that I wanted to be with and we decided that my friend was going to cook a carbonara at our friend's house and will eat there. I was able to enjoy that moment. We laugh, talk, eat and watch a show. When, we're going to be separated because we are going home, I am with the person I bring, the person I really like, while we are walking, we are talking about how the day went. I can't stop smiling because of this person, because I am really glad that he is here with me throughout the day. And then, we got home and took a rest. That day was such an unforgettable moment for me. I thank God for it.

The lesson here was we should enjoy every single moment of the day whether it is bad or good, because at the end of the day we will still be laughing at it. Spend most of your time enjoying it, don't be harsh of yourself and let yourself be happy in single things. Enjoy the life of yours with God and your friends. Let's enjoy the moment of our life.</p>
